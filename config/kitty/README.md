# Kitty config

For the themes, there's a reference in the `kitty.conf` file to a file in a `themes/` directory here. To create that directory, clone the [dexpota/kitty-themes](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes) into this directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes 
```
